# developer_technical_test

This is one of many technical test that I ever do. There is 3 question.
- Number 1 (Nomor_1) is about a string 9.86-A5.321 and I have to change this string to output 9865321, 9000000, 800000, 60000, 5000, 300, 20, and 1
- Number 2 (Nomor_2) is about swaping value of 2 integer but I can't add more variable and the code must be maximum 3 lines
- Number 3 (Nomor_3) is about to make function that can merge 2 array and make it sorted, but I can't using any merge function and sorting function
